      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="file:///Users/iva/Desktop/Coding/Iva.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Iva Trecakov">

      <p>I am from NJ and have 2 dogs, a beagle and a golden retriever. I love to hike and fly my drone which is a hobby I share with my fiancee.</p>
      <p>I am an Registered Dental Assistant and have been working at an orthodontic office since 2009. I graduated with a bacherlor's degree in Biology but I have also always had an interest in technology and more recently became interested in software engineering! I am hoping this course will teach me important fundamentals of coding so that I can integrate it into my current field and create software for orthodontics. I am open to working in all fields, however with increasing clear aligner companies such as Invisalign and Smile Direct Club, I am interested in taking it to the next level.</p>
